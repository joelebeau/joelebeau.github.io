                I've been building software professionally for nearly a decade. Prior to that, I learned to program through building games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD" noopener noreferrer>MUDs</a> and game engines like <a href="https://www.byond.com" noopener noreferrer>BYOND</a>.

                These days, I love automation. Any time I watch people repeating tasks over and over, I always think "I could save so much time and money in the long run with a little work now."

              <p class="mb-2">
                I'm also interested in minimizing cognitive load through the use of technology. We often end up working with endless streams of noisy inputs that we're expected to sift through while also doing out daily work. I'm working on building a unified dashboard that can be customized to the needs of the individual. Details TBA!

                Outside work, I'm a gamer through and through. RPGs, horror games, sims, building games, shooters, you name it.

                My partner and I live with a horde of cats. We're <i>down</i> to five. They drive me crazy, but I love them. We also have a bearded dragon and rats. You could say we're into animals.
